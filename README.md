# d_zoneeee

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started
Hello ! I am Sinchana S M . A college student trying some fun projets, here's what D_Zone is all about 
Its a flutter application designed for android ( the same can be implemented into a ios,web and windows application too with a bit extra work).
The whole Intention of this app is to map deadzones and create a report. So whats the use? Yup to answer that , its an attempt to create an report showing all the deadzones mapped, so ISPs acn use this data if required for better implementation of network towers.
How does it work?
A basic signin procedure  with a home page (which uses Firebase to collet data) and then we mainly have 4 Categories 
i) Map- integrating Google maps with help fo flutter console to get realtime map and loaction tracking. Here the interface has a "Report Location" option which marks the currect location of user as an deadzone . Note that I cant map my clg as a deadzone while sitting at home, it only marks current loaction. All users can see the dead zones reported by any other user on the map with a red mapping. 
ii) Weekly reports- This is the interface to show users how many DeadZones were mapped in that particular month in a weekly category (bargraph).
iii) DeadZones- Lists all the DeadZones with exact lat,lng and approximate Place name.
iv) Streak - An attempt to improvise user interaction by providing a streak medal based on the no of zones they mapped.

Home page also has a profile page with users email username ans signout as options with Random Gravatars assigned to their profile on their first signin. It also has a feed back floating incon in the bottom right os screen and thats also to improve user interaction.
